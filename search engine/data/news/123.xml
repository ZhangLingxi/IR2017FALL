Over the past decade or so, thanks to the width and depth of Nankai’s discipline portfolio, the CESD has been able to build China’s best research facilities for Applied Economics, featuring key branches of Industrial Economics, Key Research base for Regional Economics under China’s 985 Program, and state-level research body for modern logistics. With a great number of high-caliber graduates and a series of academic achievements leading in China, the CESD has asserted itself on its excellence in scientific research and education as well. It has also become Nankai’s platform to undertake pilot programs for innovations in scientific research, teaching, management system and mechanism, and an interface with the world for high-level academic exchanges.</snippet></doc>
