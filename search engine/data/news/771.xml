debate, which traces its history back to 1993, has deep roots in Nankai
University. With the contemporary society competition intensified, an
outstanding eloquence as well as a speculative spirit becomes a common pursuit
of talents in this new era. The Association of Debate &amp; Eloquence has accompanied
the growth and development of debate in Nankai since its foundation in 1996.
From the large-scale debate events of all kinds in the 1990s to these years’
Beijing-Tianjin region competitions, we never missed a single participation.
The cultivation of a solid debate foundation and a style aiming at seeking for
knowledge has long been our mission. We hope that debate will become an
effective approach for the college students’ self-growth promotion, comprehensive
quality improvement as well as their holistic personality formation.</snippet></doc>
