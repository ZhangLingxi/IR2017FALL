lecture, Prof. In-Hyun Park talked about his research. Rett syndrome is a raregenetic
neurological disorder that almost exclusively affects females, mainly caused by
mutations in the gene MECP2 located on the X chromosome. By using the technique
of genetic reprogramming, Prof. In-Hyun Park’s laboratory was used to obtain RTT-iPSCs
derived from Rett syndrome fibroblasts. The differentiation defects of RTT-iPSC’s neural
differentiation and Rett syndrome’are similar. It indicates that RTT-iPSC is an in
vitro model that can be used for the study of Rett syndrome and has broad prospectsfor
clinical application.</snippet></doc>
